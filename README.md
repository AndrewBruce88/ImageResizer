# ImageResizer

2022-01-28

A quick project to make a simple image scaling, cropping, and rotating application. I've found that despite there being some free options available online
and applications installed with the OS, it's still sometimes not as easy as I would like to do these basic transformations. No more need to find a website to use
to reduce the resolution of an image to reduce its size! This is useful for profile pictures, which often have a maximum file size and sometimes
require a specific height and width.

The script prompts the user to provide the filepath or filename within the current directory, then asks the user which operation to apply. It then shows the result and asks the user if they want to save this image.

Note pillow library needs to be installed. Type "pip install pillow" at the command line to do this.
